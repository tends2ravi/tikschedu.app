    <h1>Terms of Service for VidQueue</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> December 18, 2025</p>

    <h2>1. Acceptance of These Terms</h2>
    <p>
        These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of the VidQueue web application
        and any related websites, services, or features (collectively, “VidQueue” or the “Service”).
        By accessing or using VidQueue, you agree to be bound by these Terms and by our Privacy Policy.
        If you do not agree to these Terms, you must not use VidQueue.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Description of the VidQueue Service</h2>
    <p>
        VidQueue is a scheduling and workflow tool designed for TikTok creators, brands, and agencies.
        The Service allows you to connect your TikTok account via TikTok’s official APIs, plan and stage
        video uploads, and manage publishing or scheduling actions based on your instructions.
        VidQueue acts solely as an intermediary and does not own or control your TikTok account or content.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Eligibility and Account Responsibility</h2>
    <p>
        You may use VidQueue only if you are legally able to form a binding contract in your jurisdiction
        and if your use complies with all applicable laws, TikTok’s Terms of Service, and TikTok’s
        Community Guidelines. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your devices and any
        login sessions associated with VidQueue.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Your Content and Conduct</h2>
    <p>
        You are solely responsible for all videos, captions, metadata, and other materials you upload,
        schedule, or publish through VidQueue (“Your Content”). You must ensure that Your Content:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Complies with all applicable laws and regulations.</li>
        <li>Complies with TikTok’s Terms of Service, Community Guidelines, and any creator policies.</li>
        <li>Does not infringe any third party’s intellectual property, privacy, or other rights.</li>
        <li>Is not hateful, defamatory, harassing, misleading, or otherwise harmful.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        VidQueue does not review or approve Your Content before it is sent to TikTok’s systems. You
        acknowledge that actions such as uploading, scheduling, or publishing are performed on your
        behalf and at your own risk.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Use of TikTok APIs and Third‑Party Services</h2>
    <p>
        VidQueue connects to your TikTok account using TikTok’s official developer platform and APIs.
        Your use of VidQueue is in addition to, and does not replace, your obligations under TikTok’s
        own Terms of Service, Community Guidelines, and Developer Policies. You must not use VidQueue
        in any way that would cause VidQueue or you to violate TikTok’s terms or any other third‑party terms.
    </p>
    <p>
        If TikTok or any other platform revokes or limits access to its APIs or your account, VidQueue
        may lose some or all functionality for you. VidQueue is not responsible for any limitations,
        suspensions, or terminations imposed by TikTok or other third parties.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Data and Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        VidQueue’s collection and use of personal data is described in our Privacy Policy. By using
        VidQueue, you consent to our handling of information as described there, including information
        received from TikTok when you authorize VidQueue to connect to your TikTok account.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Service Availability and Changes</h2>
    <p>
        VidQueue is provided on an “as available” basis. We do not guarantee that VidQueue will always
        be available, uninterrupted, secure, or error‑free. We may modify, suspend, or discontinue any
        part of VidQueue at any time, with or without notice, including to comply with TikTok’s
        requirements or changes to its APIs.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>
        VidQueue is provided “as is” and “as available,” without warranties of any kind, whether express
        or implied, including but not limited to implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a
        particular purpose, and non‑infringement.
    </p>
    <p>
        To the maximum extent permitted by law, VidQueue and its owners, developers, and affiliates
        will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages,
        or for any loss of profits, revenues, data, or goodwill, arising out of or related to your use
        of VidQueue, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages.
    </p>
    <p>
        Without limiting the foregoing, VidQueue is not responsible for failed uploads, scheduling
        errors, rejected posts, account actions taken by TikTok, or any damage resulting from your
        reliance on VidQueue to manage your TikTok content.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Termination</h2>
    <p>
        You may stop using VidQueue at any time. We may suspend or terminate your access to VidQueue
        at our discretion, including if we reasonably believe that you have violated these Terms,
        misused TikTok’s APIs, or used VidQueue in a way that may harm other users, TikTok, or us.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Changes to These Terms</h2>
    <p>
        We may update these Terms from time to time. When we do, we will change the “Last Updated”
        date at the top of this page. Your continued use of VidQueue after any changes become effective
        constitutes your acceptance of the revised Terms. If you do not agree with the updated Terms,
        you must stop using VidQueue.
    </p>
