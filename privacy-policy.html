    <h1>Privacy Policy for Clip Planner</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> June 10, 2025</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>To provide our video scheduling service, we collect the following information via the official TikTok API after you grant authorization:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Authentication Tokens:</strong> Secure OAuth 2.0 access and refresh tokens to make authenticated API requests on your behalf. These tokens are stored securely using industry-standard encryption.</li>
        <li><strong>User Profile Information:</strong> Your basic public TikTok profile information (e.g., username, profile picture) to display within our application interface and confirm your identity.</li>
        <li><strong>Video Content:</strong> The video files and associated metadata (titles, descriptions, scheduled times) that you provide for the explicit purpose of scheduling and publication.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>Your data is used exclusively for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To authenticate your session with TikTok.</li>
        <li>To upload your video content to TikTok's servers as per your request.</li>
        <li>To publish your scheduled videos at the time you specify.</li>
        <li>To display your content schedule and history within our application for your reference.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>We will never share, sell, or rent your personal data or video content to third parties.</strong> We will not use your data for marketing or advertising purposes.</p>

    <h2>3. Data Security and Retention</h2>
    <p>We implement robust security measures to protect your information. Authentication tokens are encrypted at rest. Video files are temporarily stored on secure servers and are deleted immediately after a successful upload to TikTok.</p>

    <h2>4. Your Rights and Data Deletion</h2>
    <p>You can revoke our app's access to your TikTok account at any time directly through your TikTok account settings. Upon revocation, or upon a direct deletion request sent to vidqueue@support.com, we will permanently delete all your personal data and authentication tokens from our systems within 72 hours.</p>

    <h2>5. Contact Us</h2>
