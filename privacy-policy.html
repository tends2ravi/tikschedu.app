    <h1>Privacy Policy for VidQueue</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> December 18, 2025</p>

    <h2>1. Overview</h2>
    <p>
        This Privacy Policy explains how VidQueue (“VidQueue”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) collects, uses,
        and protects information when you use the VidQueue web application and related services
        (collectively, the “Service”). By using VidQueue, you agree to the collection and use of
        information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
        To provide the VidQueue scheduling and publishing workflow, we may collect and process the
        following information after you grant authorization:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>TikTok authentication data:</strong> OAuth 2.0 access tokens, refresh tokens, and
            related authorization data required to make authenticated requests to TikTok on your behalf.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Basic TikTok profile information:</strong> Limited account information such as your
            TikTok user ID, username, and profile image, as permitted by the TikTok permissions you grant
            to VidQueue. This is used to display your connected account inside VidQueue.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Content and scheduling data:</strong> Video files and associated metadata that you
            provide to VidQueue (for example, titles, descriptions, tags, and scheduled publish times)
            for the purpose of uploading, staging, or publishing content to TikTok.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Usage information:</strong> Basic technical information such as timestamps of actions
            (e.g., when you connect your account, upload a file, or schedule a post) and limited log data
            needed to operate and troubleshoot the Service.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. How VidQueue Uses Your Information</h2>
    <p>VidQueue uses the information described above only for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To connect VidQueue to your TikTok account after you authorize the connection.</li>
        <li>To upload, stage, schedule, and publish TikTok videos according to your instructions.</li>
        <li>To show your planned or past posts within the VidQueue interface for your reference.</li>
        <li>To maintain and improve the reliability, security, and performance of VidQueue.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <strong>VidQueue does not sell, rent, or trade your personal data or video content to third parties.</strong>
        We do not use your TikTok content for advertising or marketing on behalf of other parties.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>
        We share your information only in limited circumstances, such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>With TikTok:</strong> When you use VidQueue, we send data (for example, videos and
            metadata) to TikTok’s systems via their official APIs, as needed to perform uploads or
            publishing actions you initiate.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Service providers:</strong> We may use trusted infrastructure or hosting providers
            to run VidQueue. These providers process data on our behalf and are obligated to protect it
            appropriately.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Legal requirements:</strong> We may disclose information if required by law, regulation,
            or legal process, or to protect our rights, users, or the public.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Data Security and Retention</h2>
    <p>
        VidQueue takes reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your information from
        unauthorized access, loss, misuse, or alteration. For example, authentication tokens are stored
        using industry‑standard protections, and access to production systems is restricted.
    </p>
    <p>
        We retain information only for as long as necessary to operate VidQueue, comply with our legal
        obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. Video files that are temporarily stored
        for upload are kept only for as long as needed to complete the transfer or as otherwise required
        for the Service to function.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Your Choices and Rights</h2>
    <p>
        You can revoke VidQueue’s access to your TikTok account at any time through your TikTok account
        settings. Once revoked, VidQueue will no longer be able to act on your behalf via TikTok’s APIs.
    </p>
    <p>
        You may also request that VidQueue delete your stored personal data and tokens associated with
        your account. Upon a verified request, we will delete such data within a reasonable period,
        subject to any data we must retain for legal or security reasons.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        VidQueue is not directed to children and is intended for use only by individuals who are old enough
        to manage a TikTok account under TikTok’s own terms. We do not knowingly collect personal information
        from children. If you believe a child has provided data to VidQueue, please contact us so we can
        take appropriate steps.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will revise the “Last Updated”
        date at the top of this page. Your continued use of VidQueue after any changes becomes effective
        means you accept the updated Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, you should stop using VidQueue.
    </p>
